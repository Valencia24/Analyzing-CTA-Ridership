# Analyzing-CTA-Ridership

This program uses Python and SQL to analyze the CTA database, and its daily ridership across all stations and line colors. It begins by
outputting a series of general stats about the database information, and it then allows users to input one of 9 commands to retrieve
different information. Commands 6 through 9 also give the user the option to plot a graph to visualize the information retrieved by the SQL
queries. More in-depth information about what each command does is written above each respective command in the code comments. 
The png file is necessary for command 9's plotting option.
